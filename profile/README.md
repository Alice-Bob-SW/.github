Alice & Bob is building the first universal, fault-tolerant quantum computer, to tackle some of the world's hardest problems.

Our technology based on self-correcting cat qubits provides a solution to the biggest roadblock faced by quantum computers today: computation errors.

The very first cat qubit quantum computer is available for private beta testing. To apply and see for yourself its incredible potential, visit us at [alice-bob.com](https://alice-bob.com/)!
